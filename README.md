### About Bonus Exercise.

The bonus exercise requires create a User with Profile equals to *Standard Platform User*, and Role equals to *TN USA Sales*. This user has the following Salesforce Credentials:

* UserName: jefryruiz@gmail.com.tn
* Password: Salesforce2021

If somewhat the app works well, and only shows information related to USA cars and Sales, the Apex Tests couldnÂ´t check this behavior.
